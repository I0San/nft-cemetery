# NFT Cemetery

This is a fun little project to create a cemetery of NFTs. The idea is to create a place where you can bury your NFTs and have them rest in peace.

The repository contains two projects; contract and dApp.

The contract creates a new Grave with the Incription (limited to 50 characters), BlockNumber of death, token info and owner info and there is a public getter to retrieve the Graves on the Graveyard.

The ReactJS dApp is a simple interface to interact with the contract. It allows you to connect your wallet, approve the contract to transfer your NFTs and then bury them. You can also see the list of all the graves and the details of each grave.

## WARNING
The NFTs are burned and gone forever. You will never get them back.
